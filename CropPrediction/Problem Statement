Agriculture plays a predominant role in the economy and employment of a country.
The common problem existing among the farmers is they don't choose the right crop based on their soil requirements. 
Due to this, they face a serious setback in productivity. 
This problem of the farmers has been addressed through precision agriculture. 


Precision agriculture is a modern farming technique that uses research data of soil characteristics,
soil types, crop yield data collection and suggests the farmers the right crop based on their site-specific parameters.
This reduces the wrong choice when it comes to crop selection, and also increases productivity.
