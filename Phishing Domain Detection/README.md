# Phishing Domain Detection

Phishing stands for a fraudulent process, where an attacker tries to obtain sensitive information from the victim. Usually, these kinds of attacks are done via emails, text messages, or websites. Phishing websites, which are nowadays in a considerable rise, have the same look as legitimate sites. However, their backend is designed to collect sensitive information that is inputted by the victim. Discovering and detecting phishing websites has recently also gained the machine learning community’s attention, which has built the models and performed classifications of phishing websites.

 

The dataset consists of a collection of legitimate, as well as phishing website instances. Machine learning and data mining researchers can benefit from these datasets by easily building classification models in systems preventing phishing attacks since the presented datasets feature the attributes which can be easily extracted.
## TASK

Build a Machine Learning model that predicts whether or not an email is a Phishing email or not!

## Evaluation metric

Evaluation was done using accuracy score on the unseen test data.
