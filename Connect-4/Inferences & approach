I have made a machine learning model to find out if the first player has won 
the game or not given the connect-4 positions using SUPERVISED classification learning algorithms &
evaluated the model based on f1 score which is pretty decent 91.5%


In this I have used SMOTE in order to solve imbalance, Random forest estimator with 30 estimators
The weighted f1 score comes out to be 0.915471900100844 which ~ 91.5%. Apart from that I have also used MinMax 
Scaler in order to scale the data
